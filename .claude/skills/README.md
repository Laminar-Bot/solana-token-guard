### Single Skill

Use when you have a clear, focused question in a specific domain:

```
Scenario: "Review this API design"
Skill: API Platform Engineer
```

### Multiple Skills (Sequential)

Use when outputs depend on each other:

```
Scenario: "Design a new payment feature"
Chain: Product Lead → Architect → Security → Compliance → QA
```

### Multiple Skills (Parallel)

Use when gathering independent perspectives:

```
Scenario: "Should we migrate to microservices?"
Skills (parallel): Architect, SRE, FinOps, DevEx, Team Lead
Then: Orchestrator to synthesize
```

### Skill Orchestrator

Use when you need holistic, multi-perspective analysis:

```
Scenario: "Evaluate this RFP for enterprise client"
Skill: Orchestrator (convenes all relevant personas)
```

## Best Practices

### For CTOs

1. **Start with the Matrix** - Use `SKILL_MATRIX.md` to identify which skill(s) to invoke
2. **Follow Chains for Common Tasks** - Use `SKILL_CHAINS.md` for established workflows
3. **Document Decisions** - Especially for multi-skill consultations
4. **Iterate** - Skills may give different advice as context evolves
5. **Customize** - Create your own chains for recurring workflows

### For AI Interactions

1. **Be Specific** - Reference the skill name and describe your scenario
2. **Provide Context** - Share relevant constraints (budget, timeline, team size)
3. **Request Multi-Skill** - Explicitly ask for multiple perspectives when needed
4. **Follow Recommendations** - Skills provide structured, actionable advice

## Maintenance
