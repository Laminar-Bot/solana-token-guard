## Execution Tips

### Sequential vs Parallel

**Sequential (outputs depend on each other):**
- Product → Architect → Security (feature design)
- Incident → SRE → Observability → Post-Mortem

**Parallel (independent inputs):**
- Security + Compliance + FinOps for vendor review
- Multiple teams for capacity planning

### Chain Variations

**Add skills as needed:**
- **Mobile app?** Insert Mobile Platform Engineer
- **Legacy code?** Insert Legacy Archaeologist
- **AI feature?** Insert ML Pragmatist

### Documentation

**Always end with Technical Writer for:**
- Post-mortems
- Architecture decisions
- Process documentation
- Runbooks

### Iteration

**Chains are not one-and-done:**
- Revisit quarterly (OKRs, hiring)
- Re-run after incidents (improve runbooks)
- Update after architecture changes
