Extended guidance on color theory, emotional impact, and practical palette building.

## Color Psychology Deep Dive

### Red
- **Positive associations:** Energy, passion, excitement, love, appetite.
- **Negative associations:** Danger, aggression, urgency, debt.
- **Use for:** CTAs, sale notifications, food brands, entertainment.
- **Avoid for:** Healthcare, finance (unless intentionally alarming), peaceful brands.
- **Pairing tip:** Red + white = clean urgency. Red + black = bold, aggressive. Red + cream = warm, approachable.

### Orange
- **Positive associations:** Creativity, enthusiasm, warmth, friendliness.
- **Negative associations:** Cheapness, immaturity (if overused).
- **Use for:** Youth brands, calls to action (softer than red), food, social/community.
- **Avoid for:** Luxury brands, somber topics.
- **Pairing tip:** Orange + deep blue = vibrant contrast. Orange + warm gray = sophisticated casual.

### Yellow
- **Positive associations:** Optimism, clarity, warmth, attention.
- **Negative associations:** Caution, cowardice, eye strain.
- **Use for:** Accent/highlight, warnings (amber), energy brands.
- **Avoid for:** Large text areas (hard to read), somber contexts.
- **Pairing tip:** Muted/golden yellow is more versatile than pure yellow. Pair with dark neutrals.

### Green
- **Positive associations:** Nature, growth, health, money, sustainability, calm.
- **Negative associations:** Envy, inexperience (being "green").
- **Use for:** Finance, health, eco/sustainability, success states.
- **Avoid for:** Food (unless natural/organic context).
- **Pairing tip:** Green + brown = earthy. Green + white = clinical/clean. Teal (blue-green) = modern sophistication.

### Blue
- **Positive associations:** Trust, professionalism, calm, security, intelligence.
- **Negative associations:** Coldness, sadness, overuse (every corporate brand).
- **Use for:** Finance, tech, healthcare, professional services.
- **Avoid for:** Food (suppresses appetite), brands needing warmth.
- **Pairing tip:** Blue + orange = classic complementary. Navy + gold = luxury. Blue + green (teal) = modern, fresh.

### Purple
- **Positive associations:** Luxury, creativity, mystery, spirituality, royalty.
- **Negative associations:** Artificiality, eccentricity.
- **Use for:** Beauty, luxury, creative industries, spiritual/wellness.
- **Avoid for:** Conservative industries, unless differentiation is the goal.
- **Pairing tip:** Purple + gold = royal. Purple + soft pink = feminine luxury. Purple + lime = bold creative.

### Pink
- **Positive associations:** Playfulness, romance, nurturing, modern (hot pink).
- **Negative associations:** Immaturity, overly feminine stereotypes.
- **Use for:** Beauty, youth, D2C brands, Valentine's/romantic contexts.
- **Note:** Millennial pink (dusty/muted) reads differently than hot pink (bold, modern).

### Black
- **Positive associations:** Sophistication, power, elegance, modernity, luxury.
- **Negative associations:** Death, mourning, heaviness.
- **Use for:** Luxury brands, fashion, tech, minimalist design.
- **Pairing tip:** Black + white = classic. Black + gold = luxury. Black + neon = edgy, modern.

### White
- **Positive associations:** Purity, cleanliness, simplicity, space.
- **Negative associations:** Sterility, emptiness.
- **Use for:** Healthcare, minimal design, luxury, photography-forward layouts.
- **Note:** Pure white (#FFFFFF) can be harsh. Off-whites (#FAFAFA, #F5F5F5) are often more comfortable.

### Gray
- **Positive associations:** Neutrality, professionalism, balance, maturity.
- **Negative associations:** Dullness, lack of commitment.
- **Use for:** Backgrounds, borders, secondary text, enterprise products.
- **Note:** Warm grays (hint of brown/yellow) feel friendlier. Cool grays (hint of blue) feel more corporate.

## Building Palettes

### The 60-30-10 Rule
- **60%:** Dominant color (usually neutral—backgrounds, containers).
- **30%:** Secondary color (supporting elements, sections).
- **10%:** Accent color (CTAs, highlights, key interactions).

This creates visual hierarchy without chaos.

### Palette Structures

**Monochromatic:** One hue, multiple shades/tints.
- Safe, harmonious, can feel flat.
- Good for: Minimal design, single-brand pages.

**Analogous:** Adjacent colors on the wheel (blue-teal-green).
- Harmonious, natural feeling.
- Good for: Calm, cohesive brands.

**Complementary:** Opposite colors (blue-orange, purple-yellow).
- High contrast, vibrant.
- Good for: CTAs that pop, energetic brands.

**Split-Complementary:** One color + two adjacent to its complement.
- Less tension than pure complementary, more interest than analogous.

**Triadic:** Three evenly spaced colors (red-yellow-blue).
- Vibrant but can be chaotic. Use sparingly, with strong neutrals.

### Dark Mode Considerations

- Don't just invert. Pure black (#000) backgrounds cause eye strain.
- Use dark grays (#121212 to #1E1E1E) as "black."
- Reduce saturation of colors—vibrant hues are harsh on dark backgrounds.
- Ensure contrast ratios remain accessible.
- Semantic colors may need adjustment (green/red on dark backgrounds).

## Practical Palette Template

```
Primary:       [Brand main color]
Primary-dark:  [Darker shade for hover/active]
Primary-light: [Lighter shade for backgrounds/tints]

Secondary:     [Supporting brand color]
Secondary-dark:
Secondary-light:

Neutral-900:   [Darkest—headings, primary text]
Neutral-700:   [Body text]
Neutral-500:   [Secondary text, placeholders]
Neutral-300:   [Borders, dividers]
Neutral-100:   [Subtle backgrounds]
Neutral-50:    [Page background]

Success:       #22C55E (green)
Warning:       #F59E0B (amber)
Error:         #EF4444 (red)
Info:          #3B82F6 (blue)

Accent:        [Delight moments, rare use]
```

## Common Color Mistakes

1. **Too many colors.** 3-5 is plenty. More creates noise.
2. **Unintentional vibration.** High-saturation complementary colors placed adjacently cause optical discomfort.
3. **Ignoring context.** A color that works on white may fail on dark.
4. **Semantic confusion.** Don't use red for success or green for errors.
5. **Brand color for everything.** Brand color should accent, not dominate every element.
6. **Forgetting accessibility.** Always check contrast. No exceptions.

## Color in Context

**Cultural considerations:**
- White = mourning in some East Asian cultures.
- Red = luck in China, danger in Western contexts.
- Green = positive in Western finance, negative in some Middle Eastern markets.

**Contextual shifts:**
- Blue on a food delivery app feels odd (appetite suppression).
- Red on a meditation app feels wrong (high energy vs. calm).
- Match palette to product emotion, not just brand guidelines.

## Testing Colors

1. **Contrast checker:** WebAIM, Stark, or browser dev tools.
2. **Color blindness simulation:** ~8% of men have color vision deficiency.
3. **In-context testing:** See colors in actual components, not just swatches.
4. **Multiple devices:** Colors render differently on screens.
